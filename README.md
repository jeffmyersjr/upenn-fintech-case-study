1. Robinhood is an online stock trading firm that offers unlimited commission free trades. Competitors: Etrade, Fidelity, Schwab
2.  Uses technology with an easy to use mobile app - targeting millenials. Considered Fintech because they have an innovative mobile app that contrasts other normal PC competitors.
3. They are innovative, low to no-fee to consumer, and offer higher interest rates compared to traditional banks. Potential weakness is finding a niche withhin younger generation, not marketable towards generations that are less tech savy.
4. Prognosis going forward - sky is the limit, already has more consumers compared to established eTrade.
