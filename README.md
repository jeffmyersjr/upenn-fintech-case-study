##Robinhood Case Study

1a) Robinhood is an online stock trading firm that offers unlimited commission free trades. Competitors: Etrade, Fidelity, Schwab
1b) Uses technology with an easy to use mobile app - targeting millenials. Considered Fintech because they have an innovative mobile app that contrasts other normal PC competitors.
1c) They are innovative, low to no-fee to consumer, and offer higher interest rates compared to traditional banks. Potential weakness is finding a niche withhin younger generation, not marketable towards generations that are less tech savy.
1d) Prognosis going forward - sky is the limit, already has more consumers compared to established eTrade.
